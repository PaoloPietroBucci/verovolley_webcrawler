And the results were pretty phenomenal.In just 6 months I grew from zero followers to over 20,000.And on August 1st of 2019, I walked away from my executive role at a fast-growing startup.Since that day, I've spent my time building a number of one-person Internet businesses.My mission is to be the \"Diversified Solopreneur.\" My results:\u2192 $6.7M+ in business revenue at a 90% profit margin.\u2192 550K+ people following my journey on LinkedIn\u2192 475K+ people following my journey on Twitter\u2192 215K+ people read my weekly newsletter\u2192 600M+ impressions in the last 4 yearsIf you want to learn more about how I did this, you can take one of my self-guided courses.THE OPERATING SYSTEM DIGITAL COURSEIn this 120-minute course, you will learn the complete LinkedIn operating system that I used to grow from 0 to 500k followers and earn $6.7M+ in income with zero advertisements.

It is not just the US but pretty much everywhere IMO.Study > get good grades > get into a good college > earn a degree > get a job > slog it out until you are 60 > live on your pension..That's conventional wisdom.People who broke away from that and did things differently are the ones who have succeeded.Irrespective of what you want to do - work a 9 to 5 or, start a business - all of those 5 points apply to you..The time now is to invest in yourself and scale up so that you can enjoy what you are earning and live a life that you is fulfilling.."

The real question we should ask ourselves is not, \"how big can we get?\"  But instead, \"what kind of life do we want to live?\"  The magic happens when we shift our focus from size to significance.  You might discover that your 'enough' is a lot less than you thought.  Because we\u2019re conditioned to believe that 'more' is somehow synonymous with 'better'.  But often, it's just synonymous with more stress, more time away from family, and more sacrifices.  Maybe it's time you redefine 'enough'?  Maybe 'enough' is working on something you genuinely enjoy, serving customers who truly appreciate your product, and having time to spend with your family and loved ones.  I'd encourage you to challenge your own notions of 'enough'.

And by now, we've all seen the infamous Cloudflare and Discord 'firing videos'.  I think these serve as good reminders to 'bulk up' your personal portfolio.  If we're headed for layoffs, remember to give companies an obvious reason to choose you over other candidates.  One of the easiest ways to do this is to show off how your brain works.  How you think.  - Write useful content - Build small, helpful products - Record videos of your skills and talent - Be active where the decision makers are  Anything!  Any time you can show that you're uniquely talented, you have a better chance at standing out.  Paint? Share your paintings. What's a lesson you learned?  Write? Share it online. Talk about a great experience you had winning a deal.  Run a basketball camp? Talk about what you learned from the kids that helps you as a leader.  Get yourself out there, grab that microphone, and make yourself known to the world.  When it comes time to stand out, you'll have a leg up.

The rear tyre had gone flat and he was struggling to push it.My mentor asked me, \"Do you know what will happen if you car did not have a spare tyre?\"I looked at him shockingly and said, \"You are stuck. Because you won't even be able to push it like that biker.\"He replied, \"Exactly!\"\"Things that cannot be pushed easily, needs a spare tyre. Lest you will struggle\", he said.\"Life is not easy and pushing can be extremely difficult if your tyre goes flat. Then why do we not keep a spare tyre!\"That question is something that needs to be answered by every one of us who are the mercy of managers for their tomorrows."

Pick a topic you can talk about for 30 minutes unprepared  2. Create daily content sharing your knowledge  3. When people ask questions, DM & schedule calls.  4. Listen for common challenges during your calls.  5. Create a short video product to address those.  6. Send it to the folks you helped on those calls.  7. Ask for testimonials in exchange for it.  8 Add the testimonials to your website.  9. Charge $50 for your new course.  10. Start charging $250 for calls.  Now you have two revenue streams:  1. A simple coaching call ($250) 2. A simple digital video product ($50)  - Make the product your low-end item. - Make the coaching call your high-end item. - Use email automation to collect more testimonials.  If people can't spend $250, direct them to the product.  At the end of the product video, share a link to schedule calls.  And around the cycle goes.

My tracker could help them stay committed) - Next, I designed product graphics inside Canva- Once ready, I would publish my product on Gumroad- Finally, I would distribute it on platforms like FB Groups and Product Hunt.

When you deeply understand your clients, you can tailor your offer directly to their biggest, most expensive challenges.  And I think the most common reason more people don\u2019t do it more often is that they just don\u2019t know how.  To help fix that, I created a simple system that\u2019s helped me on my journey to $7.5M+ in revenue as a one-person business:  It\u2019s called the 30-for-30.  And it\u2019s one of the easiest \u201cplays\u201d to run as an entrepreneur (even if you don\u2019t have a big social following).  A 30-for-30 is where you offer 30 minutes of free consulting work to someone who needs it.  In exchange, you get 30 minutes of time to ask questions about their challenges so you can build a better product or service.  Here\u2019s my full playbook for an effective 30-for-30: https://lnkd.in/es9yRBCR  ~~~  \u270d\ufe0f How often do you talk to customers? \u267b\ufe0f Reshare if the 30-for-30 was helpful!",

I decided to build my own business with a different focus:  I had no interest in changing the world, building the business past 7-figures, making any grand lists, or being labeled a 'thought leader'.  And I certainly didn't want to burn out again.  Instead, I wanted to grow slowly, spend more time with my wife, work on interesting projects, travel the world, hang with my friends more frequently, and stop doing things that made me unhappy.

            "post": "If I were starting on LinkedIn today and wanted to grow a valuable audience of 500K+ here's what I'd do:  1/ Embrace an obsession:  When you embrace an obsession, you rarely need other external motivation.  You wake up each day with an intense desire to become the best in your specific obsession.  What can you research, break down, & share daily, that would feel like play instead of work?  2/ Develop unique knowledge:  This is the knowledge you have acquired on your unique journey, that other people want, but can\u2019t figure out.  The best way to develop unique knowledge is by putting maximum effort into exploring your obsession.  When you do that, you learn more than the average person, and your knowledge becomes uniquely valuable to them.  3/ Challenge pre-conceived solutions:  A lot of LinkedIn creators shine a light on problems, but then they fail to create differentiated solutions.  They have the same pitch, same buzzwords, and the same jargon as everyone else.  Instead, you should leverage your unique knowledge to bring a solution that's completely different than anything on the market.  Stand out by promising and delivering on something unorthodox.  4/ Build distribution by studying people:  To turn your content into dollars, people must know you exist.  And if you have unique knowledge, you owe it to the world to get it into their hands.  Don\u2019t copy your competition.  Instead, study human psychology, marketing, and persuasion.  And talk about that unique solution every single day online.  Build a small audience journey that takes people through discovery > trust > relationship > purchase.  5/ Scale using compounding, daily media:  Take 30 minutes each day to observe what you learned.  Tell stories, show examples, and share behind the scenes.  Content works on your behalf for hours & sometimes even days.  Classic pieces of content have lasted years or even decades.  Have at least 2 pieces of content working on your behalf in the world at all times.  TL;DR  1. Embrace your obsession 2. Develop unique knowledge 3. Challenge pre-conceived solutions 4. Build distribution by studying people 5. Scale using compounding, daily media  I cover all of this (and more) in The Operating System.

But I don\u2019t think it actually works.  Because when I tried, all I had was a collection of forced relationships. I was always the taker, and they the giver.  It felt unnatural and unsustainable.  So, I tried something different:  Instead of looking for mentors, I became someone worth mentoring.  I built businesses. I did things I used to think were beyond my reach. Some projects failed, and others succeeded.  But no matter what, I consistently took action.  And, along the way, mentors started coming to me. Not the other way around.  But that\u2019s not surprising.  Mentors (at least, the ones you want) are drawn to ambitious people with a willingness to get their hands dirty.  And who actually produce results in the process.  At the end of the day, they want a two-way value exchange \u2014 not some puppy dog looking for constant help.  So, instead of waiting around for a Mark Cuban or Jeff Bezos to land on your doorstep and teach you the path to success...  Just start doing interesting stuff.  Build. Create. Innovate. Take risks.  Overall, just be so damn interesting that those mentors you\u2019re seeking can\u2019t help but notice (and reach out to) you.  Here\u2019s how: https://lnkd.in/eG-mPCqB  ~~~  \u270d\ufe0f Does this resonate? Or am I way off? \u267b\ufe0f Reshare if you think I got it right.",

But it's not power until acted on. So if you want to do be or have something. Go do something to prove it. And by do something I mean consume a piece of information, STOP, and take action on what you learned.Mentorship only works when you take action and do what the mentor instructs. If you aren't willing to do that you are wasting the mentor's time and your time and money."
